# California Driving License Written Test Notes and Cheat Sheat

The California Driving License Knowledge Test is a written exam you need to pass in order to continue with the process of getting a DL in the state of California. Usually, the best way to prepare is to read through the California Driver Handbook, but the material is huge and not all the things can be memorized for the test. Also, some key information presented in the handbook will be faced more often in both the exam and in every-day driving.

To make things easier for you (and something that definitely helped me), you can find **important parts and critial points highlighted (and double highlighted) in the same CA Driver Handbook that I have provided above.** Per my experience, almost 95% of the questions I have faced were from the highlighted sections of the handbook provided in this repo. This includes questions from more than 15 practice tests I have given, and succesfully completing the actual written test at the DMV with 0 wrong answers.
